| Easy    | The challenge was easy to solve, it may have taken a few tries to get the right solution but it didn't require any hints or Googling.                                         |
| Medium  | I was able to solve it but was struggling with some part of the challenge. Perhaps it took more time than expected, required looking at a hint, or Googling some information. |
| Hard    | It took a long time to find a solution. I probably used some external help like Reddit posts for the challenge to get a better understanding of the type of solution needed.  |
| Extreme | I was unable to solve it. My solution is taken from someone else and I tried to learn from it what I could.                                                                   |
