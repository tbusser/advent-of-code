# Day 1: Chronal Calibration

See [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1) for the puzzle description.

## Part 1

### My solution

An easy start for the 2018 edition of Advent of Code. The solution iterates over all frequency changes and accumulates the resulting frequency.

### Optimal solution

There were no suggested improvements for my part 1 solution.

### Insights

- _Perceived difficulty_: Easy
- _Problem type_: Counting
- _Median runtime for my solution[^1]_: 395.93100µs

## Part 2

### My solution

Part two slightly more challenging. I used a set to keep track of the frequencies encountered. Once a frequency is already in the set, the solution has been found.

### Optimal solution

There were no suggested improvements for my part 2 solution.

### Insights

- _Perceived difficulty_: Easy
- _Problem type_: Cycle detection
- _Median runtime for my solution[^1]_: 16.83777ms

[^1]: Median runtime was determined over 50 samples.
