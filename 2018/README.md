# 🎄 Advent of Code 2018

These are my solutions for the 2018 challenges. I completed this edition several years after the original event, building on experience from other years.

## 🎯 Personal Goal

For this edition, I wanted to do things a little differently. In previous years, I often wondered if my solutions were the “right” ones — sometimes a challenge seemed to call for a specific algorithm to solve it efficiently, but I ended up using a different, often brute-force approach.

This time, I decided to extract as much as I could from each challenge. I will solve each problem on my own, but afterwards I will compare my solution with suggestions from ChatGPT to see if there’s a more optimal or algorithmically correct approach.

If I find a better solution, I’ll create it. My original solution files are suffixed with .mine.ts, and any improved “optimal” solutions will be suffixed with .optimal.ts.

### What do I mean by “optimal”?

A solution is optimal if it finds the answer in competitive time while remaining readable. In other words, a pragmatic solution is preferred over one that implements a fancy algorithm that would be overkill for the scope of Advent of Code challenges.

| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easy    | The challenge was easy to solve, it may have taken a few tries to get the right solution but it didn't require any hints or Googling.                                         |
| Medium  | I was able to solve it but was struggling with some part of the challenge. Perhaps it took more time than expected, required looking at a hint, or Googling some information. |
| Hard    | It took a long time to find a solution. I probably used some external help like Reddit posts for the challenge to get a better understanding of the type of solution needed.  |
| Extreme | I was unable to solve it. My solution is taken from someone else and I tried to learn from it what I could.                                                                   |
