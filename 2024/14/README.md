# Day 14: Restroom Redoubt

Part 1 was again not so hard. Multiply the X and Y deltas for the robot with the number of seconds, add these to the original X and Y location will get you their position at the end. Since we don't have an infinite grid, we need to apply a modulo the end positions to ensure they're within the grid we've been given. After the module, some X and Y positions will be negative. This won't do as they're still outside the grid. To ensure these positions are valid, add the width (for X) or height (for Y) to any negative positions. Once done you have the position of the robot after the specified number of seconds.

Determining the quadrants was also not too hard. First of all any robot positioned in the horizontal or vertical middle can be discarded. The remaining robots now have to be sorted. To start I created an array with four position: [top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right]. For each robot I started in the top left quadrant (index 0). If the x coordinate is past the middle, I add 1 to the quadrant putting the robot in the top right (index 1). Now a check for the y position, if it is below the middle I add 2 to the quadrant. This means top left (index 0) become bottom left (index 2) and top right (index 1) becomes bottom right (index 3).

Once all the robots are processed I have four numbers which I can multiply and this gives the proper answer.

I couldn't figure out part 2 with help. The challenge description was too vague. I made an assumption there would be a shape like this from the center of the top row

```

```

Unfortunately this never appeared. At this point I looked at hints from my colleagues and read the assumption that none of the robots would overlap to make the pattern. It also included a print of the shape. Now I felt bad for looking at the hints. I wish I had thought of looking for the shape I was searching for at any place in the grid. Had I done this, I would've found the answer without any help. I adapted my code to look for the pattern anywhere in the grid, this gave me a few false positives. Once I coupled my detection with the rule the shape had to be seen more than once did I find the correct answer for my input.

Because I saw a picture of the shape and where it could be located in the grid, I have to rate part 2 as hard.

Rating: **Easy** / **Hard**

## Challenge description

### Part One

One of The Historians needs to use the bathroom; fortunately, you know there's a bathroom near an unvisited location on their list, and so you're all quickly teleported directly to the lobby of Easter Bunny Headquarters.

Unfortunately, EBHQ seems to have "improved" bathroom security **again** after your last *visit*. The area outside the bathroom is swarming with robots!

To get The Historian safely to the bathroom, you'll need a way to predict where the robots will be in the future. Fortunately, they all seem to be moving on the tile floor in predictable **straight lines**.

You make a list (your puzzle input) of all of the robots' current **positions** (`p`) and **velocities** (`v`), one robot per line. For example:

```
p=0,4 v=3,-3
p=6,3 v=-1,-3
p=10,3 v=-1,2
p=2,0 v=2,-1
p=0,0 v=1,3
p=3,0 v=-2,-2
p=7,6 v=-1,-3
p=3,0 v=-1,-2
p=9,3 v=2,3
p=7,3 v=-1,2
p=2,4 v=2,-3
p=9,5 v=-3,-3
```

Each robot's position is given as `p=x,y` where `x` represents the number of tiles the robot is from the left wall and `y` represents the number of tiles from the top wall (when viewed from above). So, a position of `p=0,0` means the robot is all the way in the top-left corner.

Each robot's velocity is given as `v=x,y` where `x` and `y` are given in **tiles per second**. Positive `x` means the robot is moving to the **right**, and positive `y` means the robot is moving **down**. So, a velocity of `v=1,-2` means that each second, the robot moves `1` tile to the right and `2` tiles up.

The robots outside the actual bathroom are in a space which is `101` tiles wide and `103` tiles tall (when viewed from above). However, in this example, the robots are in a space which is only `11` tiles wide and `7` tiles tall.

The robots are good at navigating over/under each other (due to a combination of springs, extendable legs, and quadcopters), so they can share the same tile and don't interact with each other. Visually, the number of robots on each tile in this example looks like this:

```
1.12.......
...........
...........
......11.11
1.1........
.........1.
.......1...
```

These robots have a unique feature for maximum bathroom security: they can **teleport**. When a robot would run into an edge of the space they're in, they instead **teleport to the other side**, effectively wrapping around the edges. Here is what robot `p=2,4 v=2,-3` does for the first few seconds:

```
Initial state:
...........
...........
...........
...........
..1........
...........
...........

After 1 second:
...........
....1......
...........
...........
...........
...........
...........

After 2 seconds:
...........
...........
...........
...........
...........
......1....
...........

After 3 seconds:
...........
...........
........1..
...........
...........
...........
...........

After 4 seconds:
...........
...........
...........
...........
...........
...........
..........1

After 5 seconds:
...........
...........
...........
.1.........
...........
...........
...........
```

The Historian can't wait much longer, so you don't have to simulate the robots for very long. Where will the robots be after `100` seconds?

In the above example, the number of robots on each tile after 100 seconds has elapsed looks like this:

```
......2..1.
...........
1..........
.11........
.....1.....
...12......
.1....1....
```

To determine the safest area, count the **number of robots in each quadrant** after 100 seconds. Robots that are exactly in the middle (horizontally or vertically) don't count as being in any quadrant, so the only relevant robots are:

```
..... 2..1.
..... .....
1.... .....

..... .....
...12 .....
.1... 1....
```

In this example, the quadrants contain `1`, `3`, `4`, and `1` robot. Multiplying these together gives a total **safety factor** of **`12`**.

Predict the motion of the robots in your list within a space which is `101` tiles wide and `103` tiles tall. **What will the safety factor be after exactly 100 seconds have elapsed?**


### Part Two

During the bathroom break, someone notices that these robots seem awfully similar to ones built and used at the North Pole. If they're the same type of robots, they should have a hard-coded Easter egg: very rarely, most of the robots should arrange themselves into **a picture of a Christmas tree**.

**What is the fewest number of seconds that must elapse for the robots to display the Easter egg?**
